## Events
- **Daily Startup**: User (Baba) pinged with "测试一下这不正常" (Testing, this is not normal).
- **Status Check**: Ran `clawdbot status`. Gateway is running, Telegram is OK. Critical warning about loopback auth.
- **Process Conflict Handling**: Baba instructed to keep an eye on "multiple instance" conflicts and clear them up immediately if they happen. Created `MEMORY.md` to store this as a long-term rule.
